# Factory Pattern

As the owner of a car shop, you may need some exclusive models to get attention from the young boys. The factory disposes 3 new models from 3 different brands. You call the salesman to make the order

So you ordered: 2 Audi's A3, 1 Ford F250, and 1 Chevrolet Cruze

The seller passes all the details you needed to sell this car but the most important it's the price. All the prices are on the list his passed to you
