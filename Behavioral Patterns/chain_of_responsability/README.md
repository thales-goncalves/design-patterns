# Chain of Responsability

You are trying to get technical support with your internet provider, but unfortunately, in a way to improve their service a machine was added to drive their customer to the correct support. Is not always necessary to speak directly to a technical maybe a simple machine can resolve your problem or even first-level assistance (no-technical)

The first contact its with a machine the second with a human and the thir level, the technical, is only called when it's extremely necessary

A chain of responsibility can be implemented so solve this problem and drive the customer precisely until the correct support that he needs
