# Chain of Responsability

You are trying to get technical support with your internet provider, but unfortunately, in a way to improve their service a machine was added to drive their customer to the correct support. Is not always necessary to speak directly to a technical support maybe a simple machine can resolve your problem or even first-level assistance (no-technical)

The first contact its with a machine, the second with a human and the third level, the technical. It's only called when it's extremely necessary

A chain of responsability can be implemented to solve this problem and drive the customer precisely until the correct support that he needs
